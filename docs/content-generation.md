# Content Generation & Personalization

## Overview
This document details the AI-powered content generation system that creates personalized marketing materials based on enriched business profiles gathered through our current Selenium + MCP Fetch architecture.

## Content Generation Pipeline

### Current Implementation: Selenium + MCP → AI Content
The content generation process leverages high-quality data from our working pipeline:

1. **Selenium Search** → Clean search results with real Chrome browser
2. **MCP Fetch Processing** → HTML pages converted to clean Markdown
3. **AI Content Generation** → Personalized emails based on structured data

### Core Components
- **DataInterpreter** (`auto_enrich/data_interpreter.py`): Generates initial content from MCP-processed data
- **Content Templates**: Structured prompts optimized for Markdown input
- **Personalization Engine**: Adapts content using Selenium + MCP profile characteristics
- **MCP Integration**: Leverages clean, structured content for better AI outputs

## Content Types

### 1. Email Subject Lines
Personalized subject lines based on:
- Business type and industry
