# Prioritized Product Backlog - MVP

## Backlog Prioritization Framework

**Priority Levels:**
- **P0 (Critical)**: Must have for MVP - demo will fail without these
- **P1 (High)**: Should have - significantly improves demo quality
- **P2 (Medium)**: Nice to have - can be added if time permits
- **P3 (Low)**: Future enhancement - post-MVP

**Prioritization Criteria:**
1. Demo Impact (40%) - Will this wow the Florida dealers?
2. Technical Dependency (30%) - Do other features need this?
3. Risk Reduction (20%) - Does this reduce project risk?
4. Effort/Value Ratio (10%) - Quick wins prioritized
