## Critical Risks (üî¥ Must Address Before Launch)

### R1: LLM API Costs Exceed Budget
**Probability:** High | **Impact:** High | **Risk Score:** 9/10

**Description:** OpenAI/Anthropic costs spiral out of control during 10K record demo

**Impact if Realized:**
- Demo becomes economically unviable
- Burn through budget in hours
- Cannot prove unit economics

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Implement hard cost limits** in code ($100 daily max)
2. **Use GPT-4o-mini** instead of GPT-4 (80% cheaper)
3. **Aggressive caching** (7-day TTL minimum)
4. **Batch similar prompts** to reduce redundant calls
5. **Pre-calculate demo costs** and set strict limits

**Contingency Plan:**
- Switch to Groq/Together AI for cheaper inference
- Reduce email variants from 3 to 1
- Process subset of 1,000 records for demo

**Owner:** Dev 4 (AI Lead)
**Status:** üü° In Progress

### R3: Web Scraping Gets Blocked
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** High | **Risk Score:** 7/10

**Description:** Websites detect and block Playwright scraping

**Impact if Realized:**
- Cannot discover websites
- Enrichment quality drops dramatically
- Demo fails to impress

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Implement rotating user agents**
2. **Add random delays** between requests (2-5 seconds)
3. **Use residential proxies** for demo ($50 budget)
4. **Fallback to DuckDuckGo** search results only
5. **Pre-cache common dealer websites**

**Contingency Plan:**
- Manual enrichment for top 100 dealers
- Use only search results without visiting sites
- Partner with data provider for backup

**Owner:** Dev 2 (Pipeline Lead)
**Status:** üü° Planned

---

### R5: Cannot Process 10K Records in Time
**Probability:** High | **Impact:** Medium | **Risk Score:** 6/10

**Description:** System fails to handle 10K records within 30-minute target

**Impact if Realized:**
- Demo takes too long
- Lose audience attention
- Credibility damaged

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Pre-process night before demo**
2. **Increase concurrent workers to 10**
3. **Optimize database queries** (indexes, connection pooling)
4. **Implement progress caching** (resume if crashed)
5. **Use more powerful server** for demo (16GB RAM)

**Contingency Plan:**
- Demo with 1,000 records live
- Show pre-processed 10K results
- Focus on quality over quantity

**Owner:** Dev 2 (Pipeline Lead)
**Status:** üü¢ Not Started

## High Priority Risks (üü† Address This Week)

### R2: Poor Email Quality
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium | **Risk Score:** 5/10

**Description:** Generated emails are generic, irrelevant, or poorly written

**Impact if Realized:**
- Demo fails to impress dealers
- No differentiation from competitors
- No customer interest

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Fine-tune prompts** with dealer-specific context
2. **A/B test 50 examples** before demo
3. **Add industry-specific templates**
4. **Human review and editing** of demo examples
5. **Create "golden examples"** as backup

**Contingency Plan:**
- Use pre-written templates with variables
- Focus demo on data enrichment, not generation
- Hire copywriter for emergency backup

**Owner:** Dev 4 (AI Lead)
**Status:** üü° In Progress

---

### R4: Database Corruption/Data Loss
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium | **Risk Score:** 5/10

**Description:** SQLite corruption or accidental data deletion

**Impact if Realized:**
- Lose enrichment results
- Need to reprocess everything
- Demo delay

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Automated backups** every hour
2. **Use WAL mode** for SQLite
3. **Transaction logging** for recovery
4. **Test restore procedures**
5. **Keep CSV exports** as backup

**Contingency Plan:**
- Restore from hourly backup
- Re-run enrichment overnight
- Use PostgreSQL if SQLite fails

**Owner:** Dev 1 (API Lead)
**Status:** üü¢ Not Started

---

## Medium Priority Risks (üü° Monitor Closely)

### R6: Developer Gets Sick/Unavailable
**Probability:** Low | **Impact:** High | **Risk Score:** 4/10

**Mitigation:**
- Document everything in detail
- Pair programming for critical components
- Cross-train team members
- Keep implementation simple

---

### R7: API Rate Limiting
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** Low | **Risk Score:** 3/10

**Mitigation:**
- Implement exponential backoff
- Track rate limits in code
- Use multiple API keys if needed
- Process in smaller batches

---

### R8: UI Breaks on Different Browsers
**Probability:** Low | **Impact:** Medium | **Risk Score:** 3/10

**Mitigation:**
- Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Use standard CSS/JavaScript
- Provide Chrome as recommended browser
- Have fallback CLI demo ready

---

## Low Priority Risks (üü¢ Accept or Minimal Action)

### R9: Competition Copies Idea
**Probability:** Low | **Impact:** Low | **Risk Score:** 2/10

**Mitigation:**
- Move fast to market
- Focus on execution quality
- Build customer relationships
- Don't over-publicize before launch
