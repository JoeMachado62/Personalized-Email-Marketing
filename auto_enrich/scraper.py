"""
Scraper utilities for finding dealership information on the web.

This module encapsulates functions for discovering websites and
other public contact data related to a dealership. It uses
Playwright for headless browsing and includes helpers to
construct search queries and parse results. The implementation
provided here is intentionally lightweight and serves as a
template. In a production system you would likely want more
robust error handling, captcha handling and logging.

Usage:

    from auto_enrich.scraper import find_dealer_website

    url = asyncio.run(find_dealer_website("Example Auto", "Gainesville"))

To enable Playwright, install the package via pip and run the
`playwright install` command to download browser binaries.
